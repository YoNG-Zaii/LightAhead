## ‚ùì Problem Statement
The blind communities have been relying on conventional methods such as blind canes. What if they can 'see' the world through technology. That is the topic that we will address in this project.

## :gift_heart: Our Solution
*Helping the blind see the world through computer vision with external aid* <br>

## üß™ Tech

Our software prototype is a web application.
### Front-end:<br>
[`ReactJS`](https://reactjs.org/) for the components, styling and functions on the web application.

###API:<br>
[`TensorflowJS`](https://www.tensorflow.org/js) for the object detection model - [`COCO-SSD`](https://github.com/tensorflow/tfjs-models/blob/master/coco-ssd/README.md). [`COCO`](https://viso.ai/computer-vision/coco-dataset/) stands for Common Objects in Context by Microsoft, as the image dataset was created with the goal of advancing image recognition. [`SSD`](https://towardsdatascience.com/ssd-single-shot-detector-for-object-detection-using-multibox-1818603644ca#:~:text=Single%20Shot%20detector%20like%20YOLO,object%20detection%20models%20on%20VOC2007) stands for Single-Shot Multibox Detection and takes only one shot to detect multiple objects present in an image using multibox.<br>
It is significantly faster in speed and high-accuracy object detection algorithm. Through this web application, users can use their own camera-enabled devices to capture the video of their surroundings. The model will identify the objects inside the video. In particular, we want to focus the use of this application among the blind communities.




*Problem Statement*: Current LSTM price prediction models can be easily thrown off by black swan events akin to Covid-19.

*Our Solution*: We hypothesise that black swan events are characterised by sudden spikes in trading volume. For example, when there is rapid buying or selling in a short amount of time. Our app provides a platform for students, professionals and enthusiasts alike to conveniently experiment with LSTM, and study the relationship between trade volume and the accuracy of LSTM predictions relative to actual prices.

## üß™ Tech

This website is fully coded with Python. We utilised the [`Streamlit`](https://streamlit.io/) module as our web app's framework, given its simplicity and effectiveness in visualising data.

As for our stock price data, we extracted it via the [`yfinance`](https://pypi.org/project/yfinance/) API.

Data science libraries like, [`Numpy`](https://numpy.org/) and [`Pandas`](https://pandas.pydata.org/) helped us to pre-process and clean our data.

The [`Matplotlib`](https://matplotlib.org/) and [`Seaborn`](https://seaborn.pydata.org/) libraries was later used to construct our time series charts to visualise our data.

Finally, we used the LSTM prediction model to predict stock prices. Our LSTM was built using the machine learning libraries [`Keras`](https://keras.io/), [`Scikit-learn`](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/) and [`Tensorflow`](https://www.tensorflow.org/).


## üìÅ Organisation

- [.streamlit/](https://github.com/Horstann/Stock-Prediction-App/tree/main/.streamlit) contains the front-end configurations of our web app
- [app.py](https://github.com/Horstann/Stock-Prediction-App/blob/main/app.py) contains the Python code of our Streamlit framework, LSTM prediction model and data visualisation
- [requirements.txt](https://github.com/Horstann/Stock-Prediction-App/blob/main/requirements.txt) contains all the libraries and modules required to execute our web app, alongside their respective versions

## ‚öô How To Use
1. First, type in the **ticker** symbol you're looking for.
2. If it is a valid ticker symbol, the app will display a full description of the stock and its interactive time series chart.
3. Next, click the arrow icon on the top left corner. This opens up a sidebar. Select the date you 3. wish to start predicting the stock price from.
4. Give a moment for the model to process your input.
5. And that's it! The prediction will appear magically before your eyes. It's that **easy**!
